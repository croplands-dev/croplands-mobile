##Global Food Security-Support Analysis Data##
###About###
>The GFSAD30 is a NASA funded project to provide high resolution global cropland data and their water use that contributes towards global food security in the twenty-first century. The GFSAD30 products are derived through multi-sensor remote sensing data (e.g., Landsat, MODIS, AVHRR), secondary data, and field-plot data and aims at documenting cropland dynamics from 1990 to 2017.

Mapping global croplands using remote sensing technologies present many challenges. One of the greatest challenges is in obtaining training and validation data for the classification algorithms. This application allows users to collect the necessary information and help to support food security around the globe.
